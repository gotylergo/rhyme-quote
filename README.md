## What's RhymeQuote?
RhymeQuote is a web app designed to find and display two quotes that rhyme.

## How does it work?
First we make an API call to a self hosted quote database from The Web Miner to find a quote that ends in the inputted word. Then, we call the Rhymebrain API to find possible rhymes, and search the database for each until a rhyme is matched. We then use JQuery to manipulate the webpage and display the new found "RhymeQuote." RhymeQuote also implements the Materialize framework for styling and CSS animation.
